# Vagrant-scotch-lamp
My personal modified Vagrant lamp file based on scotch box

##This version includes:

## My Features

- Multisite settings ready
- Folder db for database
- Mysql dump backups on each provision by date

## Quick setup

- Add projects on vagrant file at line 25 each project should be added with quots, example: "project1.dev" "yourdomain.dev" "projectnamex.dev" and so on.
- After adding a project run vagrant up then vagrant provision so it creats the necesary folders.
- Add your new project domain to the host list of your system, on a windows machine this is located at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts remeber this file can only be edited by admin or root. Host should start with the box ip 192.168.33.10 then your project domain an example of how it should look:
 
192.168.33.10 project1.dev
192.168.33.10 domainxyz.dev
192.168.33.10 mydomainname.dev
192.168.33.10 project201.dev

## Get Started

* Download and Install [Vagrant][3]
* Download and Install [VirtualBox][4]
* Clone the Scotch Box [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ivcreative/Vagrant-scotch-lamp.git)
* Run ``` vagrant up ```
* Access Your Project at  [http://192.168.33.10/][14]

## Basic Vagrant Commands


### Start or resume your server
```bash
vagrant up
```

### Pause your server
```bash
vagrant suspend
```

### Delete your server
```bash
vagrant destroy
```

### SSH into your server
```bash
vagrant ssh
```



## Database Access

### MySQL 

- Hostname: localhost or 127.0.0.1
- Username: root
- Password: root
- Database: scotchbox

### PostgreSQL

- Hostname: localhost or 127.0.0.1
- Username: root
- Password: root

## Mailcatcher

Just do:

```
vagrant ssh
mailcatcher --http-ip=0.0.0.0
```

Then visit:

```
http://192.168.33.10:1080
```


## Updating the Box

Although not necessary, if you want to check for updates, just type:

```bash
vagrant box outdated
```

It will tell you if you are running the latest version or not, of the box. If it says you aren't, simply run:

```bash
vagrant box update
```


## Setting a Hostname

If you're like me, you prefer to develop at a domain name versus an IP address. If you want to get rid of the some-what ugly IP address, just add a record like the following example to your computer's host file.

```bash
192.168.33.10 whatever-i-want.local
```

Or if you want "www" to work as well, do:

```bash
192.168.33.10 whatever-i-want.local www.whatever-i-want.local
```

Technically you could also use a Vagrant Plugin like [Vagrant Hostmanager][15] to automatically update your host file when you run Vagrant Up. However, the purpose of Scotch Box is to have as little dependencies as possible so that it's always working when you run "vagrant up".


## Configuration

You may want to change some of the out-of-the-box configurations for
the various parts that come with Scotch Box.  To do so, `vagrant ssh`
into the box, and edit the appropriate file.  For example, to change
PHP settings:

    vagrant ssh
    sudo vim /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/user.ini

Note that the changes that you make will be for the current running
Scotch Box only.  If you `vagrant destroy` and then `vagrant up` your
box again, these manual configuration changes will be lost.

If you prefer to automate your configuration changes so that you can
destroy and re-create boxes as needed, Vagrant allows you to create a
"provision script" that runs as part of `vagrant up`.  See the
[Vagrant
documentation](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/provisioning.html)
for notes.  For example, you could add the following line to your
Vagrantfile under the `config.vm.hostname = "scotchbox"` line:

    config.vm.provision :shell, path: "bootstrap.sh"

and then create `bootstrap.sh` with the following content in the same
directory as the Vagrantfile:

    #!/bin/bash
    # Disable Zend OPcache
    sed -i 's/;opcache.enable=0/opcache.enable=0/g' /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini

This script will be run each time you `vagrant up`, and it can be run
on an already-up box using `vagrant provision`.
